      I'm Diego Scaro, a designer and developer based in Berlin. I recently made
      this website for MIV, a new music label, also from Berlin. And I designed
      and developed the front end of this website for a retail production
      agency. You can read more about my career and skills here, and see more of
      my graphic work here.
